/**
 * Where the web client keeps unsent work and choices on this device (F01).
 *
 * In IndexedDB where the browser has it: every change to a key is one
 * readwrite transaction, read, merge and write together, and the browser
 * runs those one at a time for every tab and process of this site. Tabs in
 * different processes each keep their own copy of localStorage and hear of
 * each other's writes a moment later, so with localStorage alone two tabs
 * could each merge into a copy without the other's change and one would be
 * lost. A change is acknowledged when its transaction completes.
 *
 * A transaction a closing page started may never complete, which
 * localStorage's immediate writes never risked. So each change is first
 * written down, as data, in a small localStorage journal, synchronously,
 * and made the next time the client starts if it was not finished. Which
 * tab made each change, and how many it had made, is kept beside every
 * value in the same transaction, so a change found written down is made
 * once: never again after it was made, even when it was another open tab's
 * change still being finished and that tab has made newer ones since. Other
 * tabs are told of each change over a BroadcastChannel.
 *
 * IndexedDB ownership does not depend on BroadcastChannel. Opening failure
 * is unreadability, never an empty alternative store; later calls may retry.
 * Browsers without IndexedDB can use localStorage only until this profile
 * has used IndexedDB. Old fallback drafts/outbox are reconciled rather than
 * discarded. Other conflicting legacy copies remain until an explicit set.
