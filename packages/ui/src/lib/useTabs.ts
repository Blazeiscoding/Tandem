 * A row of tabs, as the WAI-ARIA tabs pattern has them. The row is a named
 * tablist with exactly one tab selected, and only that tab is in the Tab order,
 * so the row is one Tab stop. Left and Right move to the previous and next tab,
 * wrapping at either end, and Home and End go to the first and last. A key held
 * with Alt, Ctrl or Meta is left alone, so Alt+Left still goes Back.
 *
 * Selection follows focus: moving to a tab shows its panel at once. The pattern
 * recommends that when a panel shows without a wait, and every panel here does,
 * or says it is loading.
 *
 * There is one panel, whose content changes with the selected tab. Every tab
 * names it in `aria-controls`, and it takes its name from the selected tab.
