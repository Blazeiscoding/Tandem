/**
 * Keeps unsent work on this device, scoped to the authenticated workspace and
 * account.
 *
 * Every window open on the account shares one stored outbox. Each writes only
 * its own sends and the ones it saw delivered or discarded, merged in one step
 * by the platform (see `mergeWorkspaceOutbox`), and takes on what the others
 * wrote about the sends it holds: one taken out elsewhere goes here too, and a
 * refusal given elsewhere stops it here until its author chooses Retry.
 *
 * Drafts are shared the same way. A window writes only the drafts it changed
 * (see `mergeWorkspaceDrafts`), so one typed in one conversation is not lost
 * to another window's write about a different one, and a draft cleared or
 * sent elsewhere is not put back by a window that still showed it. A window
 * takes on the drafts the others change, except one it has its own change to
 * not yet written: that is written next, and the later edit is the draft.
 *
 * A send is kept on this device once the outbox write carrying it resolves;
 * from then a restart brings it back. Until then a draft already saved with
 * its words stays saved: a draft is written only after the outbox write
 * before it has succeeded, so a process that dies in between comes back with
 * the words in the composer rather than losing both. A write that fails says
 * so, keeps the draft as it was on disk, and is made again on Retry.
 *
 * A page that is hidden or closing writes at once, waiting for nothing, since
 * it may not live to: its outbox, and each draft it changed except one a send
 * not yet stored came from, which still waits for the outbox write (F01).
 *
 * Words sent before their draft was first saved have no saved draft to fall
 * back on. While outbox writes fail, the sends the outbox has not stored are
 * kept by nonce under a key of their own, and a restart puts any the outbox
 * still does not hold back in their composer: their words come back once, as
 * a draft or as a send, never as both. An ordinary send writes nothing there.
