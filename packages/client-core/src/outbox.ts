 * window wrote last. A send taken out, because it was delivered or its author
 * discarded it, leaves a tombstone: no window can put it back, however stale
 * its copy. A tombstone is let go only once its send is too old to be sent on
 * its own (see `OUTBOX_TOMBSTONES_KEPT`), and a floor then refuses it instead.
 * Between two versions of the same send, the newer revision wins, so a
 * refusal written by one window cannot be undone by another that has not seen
 * it; only a newer change, such as its author choosing Retry, replaces it.
 *
 * Kept free of anything but plain data so the desktop app's main process can
 * run the same merge, in one step, for every window at once.
