/**
 * What a page served by this workspace is allowed to do.
 *
 * The client has no inline scripts, no `innerHTML`, and no `eval`, so
 * `script-src 'self'` costs nothing and is the directive that actually matters:
 * it means injected markup cannot become running code, which is the failure a
 * chat application is most exposed to, since its whole job is displaying text
 * other people wrote. `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` beside it lets the app compile
 * WebAssembly it ships (strong noise suppression for calls) and nothing else:
 * JavaScript `eval` and `new Function` stay refused.
 *
 * `connect-src` is deliberately open. The browser client is a static app that
 * can be pointed at any workspace — that is how someone signs in to a server
 * other than the one that served the page, and how one browser holds several
 * workspaces at once. Narrowing it would break that rather than protect
 * anything, since the client is supposed to talk to addresses this server has
 * never heard of.
