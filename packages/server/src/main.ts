Usage: slackoss-server [options]
       slackoss-server backup  --data <dir> --out <dir>
       slackoss-server restore --from <dir> --data <dir>
       slackoss-server verify-backup --from <dir>
       slackoss-server recover --data <dir> [--handle <handle>] [--make-owner]

  --data <dir>      Data directory (default ./data)
  --port <port>     Port to listen on (default ${DEFAULT_PORT})
  --host <host>     Host to bind (default 0.0.0.0, or 127.0.0.1 with --isolated)
  --name <name>     Workspace name (persisted on first run)
  --invite-only     Require an invite code to register
  --access-policy <invite_only|account_required|guest_allowed>
                    Who may join: invited accounts, any account, or guests
                    with a display name too (saved; overrides --invite-only)
  --no-mdns         Do not advertise on the local network
  --storage-limit-mb <n>
                    Attachment storage cap in MiB; 0 is unlimited (default).
                    Also settable with TANDEM_STORAGE_LIMIT_MB
                    (the older GATHERLINE_ and SLACKOSS_ names still work).
  --abandoned-upload-hours <n>
                    How long an upload may sit unattached before it is freed
                    (default 24). Attachments a scheduled message still needs
                    are never swept, however old they are. Also settable with
                    TANDEM_ABANDONED_UPLOAD_HOURS
                    (the older GATHERLINE_ and SLACKOSS_ names still work).
  --retention-days <n>
                    Discard conversation older than this many days; 0 keeps
                    everything (default). What it removes is removed from the
                    database, not hidden: getting it back means restoring a
                    backup taken before the sweep ran. A thread goes as one
                    thing, once its newest reply is past the window too. Also
                    settable with TANDEM_RETENTION_DAYS
                    (the older GATHERLINE_ and SLACKOSS_ names still work).
  --web <dir>       Serve the browser client from this directory
  --public-url <u>  How others reach this server, e.g. https://chat.team.dev
                    (set it behind a reverse proxy; used in URLs given to apps)
  --trust-proxy     Believe the X-Forwarded-* headers. Only set this when a
                    reverse proxy in front of this server writes them and
                    nothing else can reach it directly; anyone can send those
                    headers, and a forged one would decide where an app sends
                    its reply. Setting --public-url is the better answer where
                    the address is fixed, and does not require trusting anyone.

  --no-rate-limits  Do not ration requests. One caller is otherwise held to a
                    fair share of sign-in attempts, messages, uploads, sockets
                    and typing notices; limits are keyed on the account where
                    there is one, so a whole office behind a single address
                    does not share one person's allowance. Turn this off only
                    on a network where everyone is already trusted. Also
                    settable with TANDEM_RATE_LIMITS=off
                    (the older GATHERLINE_ and SLACKOSS_ names still work).

  --skip-upgrade-backup
                    Do not copy the workspace before upgrading it to a newer
                    schema. The copy goes in pre-upgrade/ inside the data
                    directory and the three most recent are kept; it is what
                    rolling back an upgrade restores. Skip it only when you
                    have just taken a backup yourself and have no disk space
                    for a second copy.

  --isolated        Start a copy only to look at it, such as a backup restored
                    to check it. Messages scheduled in it are not posted, apps
                    are sent nothing, and it is not announced on the network,
                    so the copy cannot repeat what the original already did.
                    It listens on this machine only unless --host says
                    otherwise. Started again without it, the same data posts
                    and delivers whatever is waiting.

  --allow-private-hooks
                    Let slash commands and event subscriptions call private
                    addresses (192.168.x, 10.x, localhost). Off by default:
                    this server can reach your whole LAN, and an admin-typed
                    URL should not become a way to probe it. Turn it on when
                    your bots really do run on the same network.

Backups

  backup          Copy a workspace to a new, empty directory: the database as
                  a consistent snapshot, every attachment, and a manifest with
                  checksums and the schema version. Stop the server first for a
                  backup that is certain to be complete.
  verify-backup   Check a backup's checksums and database without restoring it,
                  and list what starting it would reach outside itself: the
                  addresses of its apps, messages waiting to be posted, app
                  events not yet delivered and sign-ins it would accept.
  restore         Replace --data with a backup, after verifying it. The old
                  directory is renamed rather than deleted. Stop the server
                  before restoring. To check a backup without replacing
                  anything, restore it into a new directory and start that
                  with --isolated.

Recovery

  recover         Get back into a workspace nobody can sign in to. Run it on
                  this machine, with the server stopped. Without --handle it
                  lists the accounts; with one it issues a temporary password
                  for that account, ends its sessions, and requires a new
                  password at next sign-in. --make-owner also hands the
                  workspace to that account, which is the way back from an
                  owner who has left. This needs the workspace file, so it
                  gives away nothing that reading the file did not already.
