/**
 * Accounts for stored blobs and reserves chunks before concurrent streams write
 * them, so the limit holds against uploads arriving at once rather than only
 * against one at a time.
 *
 * Reserving per chunk means two streams that reach the wall together can each
 * be holding part of the remaining space, and both are then refused even though
 * either alone would have fitted. That is the deliberate trade: the alternative
 * is reserving the maximum file size up front, which would cap concurrent
 * uploads at limit/maxFileSize however small they actually are. Refusing is
 * recoverable — the space is released and a retry succeeds — so the property
 * worth keeping is that the limit is never exceeded.
