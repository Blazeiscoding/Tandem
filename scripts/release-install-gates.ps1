# The release gates a Windows installer passes before it is published (IMP-08):
# it installs silently for the current user and says what version it
# installed, the installed app starts and registers the tandem://,
# gatherline:// and slackoss:// links, installing over the previous release
# keeps that release's data, and uninstalling removes the app but keeps the
# person's data.

#   ./scripts/release-install-gates.ps1 -Installer <new Setup.exe> -Version <x.y.z> [-Previous <old Setup.exe>]
#
# Run on a disposable Windows machine (a CI runner): it installs, launches and
# uninstalls the real app for the current user.
#
# The installed app is asked which profile it is using (F05): started with
# TANDEM_RELEASE_GATE_REPORT, it writes its data folder, version, revision
# and what it read there. An upgrade passes only when the new process is
# using the previous release's folder and reads the marker left in it; a
# folder that merely exists, or a registry entry, proves neither.
