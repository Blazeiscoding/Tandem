/**
 * How long database work holds up the event loop the desktop app's window
 * shares with its embedded server. The server runs in Electron's main
 * process, so while a synchronous SQLite call runs, the window cannot be moved
 * or resized smoothly and no IPC call is answered.
 *
 * Seeds a workspace with `--messages` messages (50,000 by default), half of
 * them older than the retention window and a tenth of them replies in a thread
 * of their own channel, then times the longest single stall during each piece
 * of work: reading, searching, many readers at once, the scheduled queue with
 * messages due and held, backing up, starting and retention. Every request has
 * to succeed, and the fixture is checked before anything is timed, so a number
 * here is never the cost of an error page. Run with the server package's tsx:
 *
 *   pnpm --filter @slackoss/server exec tsx ../../scripts/measure-stall.mts
