# Integration API contract

This is what a Slack-shaped integration can rely on from this server, and where
it differs from Slack. It is deliberately narrower than Slack's platform: the
aim is that the common integrations — a webhook that posts, a bot that answers
a slash command or a button, an app that listens for events — work by changing
the URL they talk to, and that everything else fails with a name rather than
quietly.

The tables marked _checked_ below are read by
`packages/server/test/integrationContract.test.ts`, which fails if they stop
matching the server. Everything else here was confirmed against a running
server when written.

## Setting up an app

An administrator creates an app under **Apps and integrations**. Each app gets:

- a **bot user**, which is who its messages are posted as;
- a **bot token** (`xoxb-…`), shown once and stored only as a hash — **New bot
  token** replaces it;
- a **signing secret**, used to sign every request this server makes to the app
  — **Replace** beside it issues a new one;
- any number of **incoming webhooks**, one per channel, each with a secret URL —
  **New URL** replaces one.

There is no OAuth installation flow and no scopes. A bot token can call every
method listed below, limited by what its bot user can reach: private channels
and group conversations only once the bot has been added to them.

## Identifiers

Slack's identifiers are replaced by this server's own, and code that looks
inside them will break:

- **`ts` is a message id**, a 26-character ULID such as
  `01M2BW7HJXR0WVPZ72M23ZAD98`. It sorts chronologically as a string, as Slack's
  does, but it is **not a decimal timestamp**. Code that parses `ts` as a number
  or derives a time from it will not work; use `event_time` or the message
  itself. `thread_ts` is the id of the thread's first message.
- **Channel and user ids** are ULIDs too, without Slack's `C…`, `D…` or `U…`
  prefixes.
- **`bot_id` is the app's id.** There is no separate bot identity.
- **`team_id`** is the workspace id, which stays the same across renames,
  address changes and restores from backup.

## Verifying requests from this server

Every request this server makes to an app — slash commands, button presses,
form submissions, event deliveries and URL checks — is signed as Slack signs:

```
basestring = "v0:" + <X-Slack-Request-Timestamp> + ":" + <raw request body>
signature  = "v0=" + hex(HMAC-SHA256(signing secret, basestring))
```

The signature is sent as `X-Slack-Signature` with its timestamp in
`X-Slack-Request-Timestamp`, and repeated as `X-SlackOSS-Signature` and
`X-SlackOSS-Request-Timestamp`. A verifier written for Slack, including Bolt's,
works unchanged. Verify against the raw body, compare in constant time, and
reject a timestamp more than five minutes from your clock so a captured request
cannot be replayed:

<!-- checked: verify-signature -->

```js
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

export function verifySlackRequest(signingSecret, headers, rawBody, now = Date.now()) {
  const timestamp = Number(headers["x-slack-request-timestamp"]);
  const signature = String(headers["x-slack-signature"] ?? "");
  if (!Number.isInteger(timestamp) || Math.abs(now / 1000 - timestamp) > 300) return false;
  const expected =
    "v0=" + createHmac("sha256", signingSecret).update(`v0:${timestamp}:${rawBody}`).digest("hex");
  const a = Buffer.from(signature);
  const b = Buffer.from(expected);
  return a.length === b.length && timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}
```

Every outbound call has **four seconds** to answer (Slack allows three) and a
reply of at most 64 KB. Redirects are not followed. By default the server will
not call a private or loopback address; start it with `--allow-private-hooks`
for an app running on the same network.

## Web API methods

Methods are called at `https://<server>/api/<method>`, as `POST`, with the token
as `Authorization: Bearer xoxb-…` or as a `token` field in the body. A body can
be JSON or form-encoded; in a form, a structured argument such as `blocks` or
`view` is a JSON string, which is how Slack's SDK sends every call.

As on Slack, a call that fails is answered with **HTTP 200** and
`{"ok": false, "error": "<code>"}`. Slack's SDK treats any other status as a
failure to connect and never reads the error code, so this matters more than it
looks. The one exception is rate limiting: **429** with a `Retry-After` header,
which the SDK understands.

The supported methods — _checked_:

| Method             | Arguments honoured                       | Notes                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth.test`        | —                                        | Returns `url`, `team`, `user`, `team_id`, `user_id`, `bot_id`. Bolt calls this before it will start. |
| `chat.postMessage` | `channel`, `text`, `blocks`, `thread_ts` | Returns `ok`, `channel`, `ts`, and this server's own `message` object.                               |
| `views.open`       | `trigger_id`, `view`                     | Returns `ok` and `view` with `id` and `callback_id` only.                                            |

**Any other method** answers `unknown_method`. That includes `chat.update`,
`chat.delete`, `chat.postEphemeral`, `conversations.*`, `users.*`,
`reactions.*`, `files.*`, `views.update`, `views.push`, `views.publish`, and
`apps.connections.open` — so **Socket Mode is not supported**; an app receives
events and interactions over HTTP.

### `chat.postMessage`

- `channel` is a channel id or `#name`. **A user id is not accepted**: this does
  not open a direct message, and answers `channel_not_found`.
- Posting to a **public** channel does not require the bot to be a member —
  as if every app had Slack's `chat:write.public`. A private channel or group
  conversation does, and answers `not_in_channel` otherwise.
- `text` wins when both `text` and `blocks` are given, though the buttons in
  `blocks` are still drawn; `blocks` alone are turned into text (see
  [Block Kit](#block-kit)).
- A `thread_ts` that is not the first message of a thread in that channel is
  ignored, and the message is posted to the channel.
- Not honoured: `attachments`, `username`, `icon_emoji`, `icon_url`, `as_user`,
  `reply_broadcast`, `mrkdwn`, `parse`, `link_names`, `unfurl_links`,
  `unfurl_media` and `metadata`.

| Error               | When                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `invalid_auth`      | The token is missing, unknown, replaced, or its app is deactivated |
| `channel_not_found` | No such channel, or it is archived                                 |
| `not_in_channel`    | A private conversation the bot has not been added to               |
| `no_text`           | Neither `text` nor `blocks` produced anything to post              |

### `views.open`

A `trigger_id` comes with a slash command, a button press or a form submission.
It **lasts three minutes** (Slack's last three seconds, which is unkind to an app
on a cold start), opens one view, and belongs to the app it was issued to and
the person whose action produced it. The view is shown only to that person.

What a view can contain is described under [Modals](#modals).

| Error                  | When                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invalid_auth`         | As for `chat.postMessage`                                           |
| `expired_trigger_id`   | Unknown, used, or older than three minutes — or its room has closed |
| `trigger_not_yours`    | Issued to a different app                                           |
| `unsupported_elements` | Every input in the view was a kind this server cannot draw          |
| `no_inputs`            | The view has no inputs at all                                       |

## Incoming webhooks

`POST https://<server>/hooks/<secret>` with a JSON body, or a form with a
`payload` field holding the JSON — the older shape many tools still send.

- `text`, `blocks`, or both, with the same rules as `chat.postMessage`.
- Success is **HTTP 200** with the body `ok`, as on Slack.
- The channel is fixed when the webhook is created; a `channel` field is ignored.

| Status | Error               | When                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 404    | `invalid_webhook`   | The secret is unknown, replaced, or its app is deactivated |
| 400    | `invalid_payload`   | The body is not JSON                                       |
| 400    | `no_text`           | Nothing to post                                            |
| 404    | `channel_not_found` | The channel is gone or archived                            |
| 403    | `not_in_channel`    | A private conversation the bot has since left              |

Errors come back as `{"ok": false, "error": "<code>"}` rather than Slack's bare
text.

## Slash commands

An administrator registers a command against a URL. When someone runs it, the
app receives a form-encoded `POST` with `command`, `text`, `team_id`,
`team_domain`, `channel_id`, `channel_name`, `user_id`, `user_name`,
`api_app_id`, `response_url` and `trigger_id`. There is no legacy verification
`token`; check the signature instead.

The app's **immediate answer**, within four seconds:

- an empty body acknowledges the command and shows nothing;
- plain text is shown privately to the person who ran it;
- JSON with `text` or `blocks` is shown privately, or posted to the channel as
  the bot with `"response_type": "in_channel"`.

A command run from inside a thread answers in that thread. If the app answers
with an error status, or not in time, the person who ran it is told privately
that the command failed.

### `response_url`

Accepts a JSON `POST` with the same fields as an immediate answer, **five times
within thirty minutes**, as on Slack. It is spent early if the app is deleted or
deactivated, its bot loses access to the conversation, the conversation is
archived, or the person it answers is deactivated — and then answers **404**
`expired_url`. It is held in memory, so a restart ends it.

## Interactive buttons

An app's buttons call its **interactivity URL**, which an administrator sets in
Apps and integrations. Unlike on Slack, the URL must echo a `url_verification`
challenge (see [Events](#events)) before it is accepted, so this server cannot
be aimed at an unrelated host.

A press posts a form with a `payload` field holding Slack's `block_actions`
payload: `team`, `user`, `api_app_id`, `channel`, `message` (with `ts`, `text`
and `user`), `container`, `trigger_id`, `response_url`, and one entry in
`actions` with `type: "button"`, `action_id`, `block_id`, `text`, `value`,
`style` and `action_ts`.

The answer — immediately or through the `response_url` — is handled like a slash
command's, plus:

- `"replace_original": true` rewrites the message the button was on, and its
  buttons go with it;
- `"delete_original": true` removes that message.

Both work through the `response_url` too, which is where Bolt's `respond()`
sends them after acknowledging the press.

A button with an `http(s)` `url` opens the link in the person's browser and calls
nothing. Only buttons are drawn from an `actions` block.

## Modals

A view is Slack's `modal` reduced to what this server can draw:

- `title`, `submit`, `close`, `callback_id` and `private_metadata`;
- `input` blocks holding a `plain_text_input` (with `multiline`, `placeholder`
  and `initial_value`) or a `static_select` (with up to 100 `options` and
  `initial_option`), with `label`, `hint` and `optional`. A select left with no
  usable options is dropped;
- `header`, `section`, `context` and `divider` blocks, shown as text above the
  inputs.

An input of any other kind — a date picker, a multi-select, a checkbox — is
**dropped** rather than drawn as a control that does nothing. At most 25 inputs
are kept.

Submitting posts a form with a `payload` field holding Slack's `view_submission`:
`team`, `user`, `api_app_id`, a fresh `trigger_id`, and `view` with `id`,
`callback_id`, `private_metadata`, `title` and `state.values`, where each value
is `{"type": "plain_text_input", "value": "…"}` or
`{"type": "static_select", "selected_option": {"value": "…"} | null}`.

Before anything reaches the app, the server refuses a submission that leaves a
required input empty or chooses an option the select never offered, so an app
never has to defend against a form its own view forbids.

The app's answer:

- anything that is not an error closes the view, including an empty body;
- `{"response_action": "errors", "errors": {"<block_id>": "<message>"}}` keeps it
  open with each message shown against its input;
- an answer that starts like JSON but cannot be read keeps it open, and the
  person is told the app's answer could not be read;
- an error status, or no answer within four seconds, keeps it open and says so.

`response_action` values `update`, `push` and `clear` are **not supported**; the
view closes. A view is open for thirty minutes, and is closed without reaching
the app if its conversation or app goes away in that time.

## Events

An app subscribes a URL to events in Apps and integrations. The URL must first
answer a `url_verification` request — `{"type": "url_verification", "token": "",
"challenge": "…"}` — by echoing the `challenge`, either as the whole body or as
`{"challenge": "…"}`.

Each event then arrives as:

```json
{
  "type": "event_callback",
  "event_id": "Ev1234",
  "event_time": 1789291228,
  "team_id": "01M2D12P7QFB85N50CZ4MHTV46",
  "event": { "type": "message", "channel": "…", "user": "…", "text": "…", "ts": "…" },
  "slackoss": { "type": "message.created", "seq": 1234 }
}
```

`slackoss` carries this server's own event name and its position in the
workspace's event log. There is no `api_app_id`, `authorizations`,
`event_context` or verification `token`.

What is delivered:

- events from **channels the bot has been added to**, and workspace-wide events
  such as a new member;
- **never** an event caused by the app's own bot, which is how a bot that answers
  messages ends up answering itself forever;
- only the event types the subscription names, using the native names in the
  table below, or every type if it names none.

How it is delivered:

- **at least once.** A crash after the app answered but before the delivery was
  recorded sends it again with the same `event_id`, so deduplicate on it;
- **in order** for each subscription, and in parallel across subscriptions;
- a `2xx` answer within four seconds is a delivery. Anything else is retried
  after 5 seconds, 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and
  6 hours — eight attempts in all — with `X-Slack-Retry-Num` and
  `X-Slack-Retry-Reason: http_error` on each retry;
- at most **500** events wait for one subscription. Past that, new events are
  counted as dropped and shown beside the subscription;
- an endpoint that uses up its attempts has the rest of its queue given up with
  it. An administrator can retry the whole queue, in order, from Apps and
  integrations.

What an edit or a deletion does to an event not yet delivered: a message's
words are taken out of every event about it that is still waiting, or that
gave up, in the same write that edits or deletes it, and the same happens when
the retention window discards it. The events themselves stay, in order and with
their `event_id`: an app that is behind receives the `message` with an empty
`text` (or a `message_changed` whose `message.text` is empty), then the edit or
deletion that supersedes it, as a client catching up on the event log does.
Only the words are taken out; who wrote it, where and when stay. An event
already delivered belongs to the app and cannot be called back, and one that was
on its way out at that moment may still arrive as it was.

## Block Kit

Blocks are **flattened to text** rather than rendered, so a message written for
Slack still reads sensibly:

- `header` becomes bold text;
- `section` contributes its `text` and each of its `fields`;
- `context` contributes its text elements, joined; images are dropped;
- `divider` becomes a line;
- `actions` contributes **buttons** — up to 25, with text up to 75 characters and
  `value` up to 2,000 — and nothing else; selects, date pickers and overflow
  menus are dropped;
- anything else, such as `image` or `rich_text`, is dropped.

Message text is a subset of Slack's mrkdwn. Drawn as formatting: `*bold*`,
`_italic_`, `~strike~`, `` `code` ``, ` ``` ` code blocks, bare `http(s)` links,
`<@user id>` and `<#channel id>` mentions, and `<!here>`, `<!channel>` and
`<!everyone>`. A backslash before a formatting character shows it literally.
**Not interpreted:** Slack's `<https://…|label>` links (the label is not shown
as link text), `>` quotes and list markers, which appear as the characters typed,
and date formatting such as `<!date^…>`.

## The native client protocol

The first-party clients use a WebSocket at `/ws` and the REST routes under
`/api/`. They are not a stable public API — they change with the clients, and
are versioned by `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in `packages/protocol` — but an outline:

1. The client opens the socket and, within 10 seconds, sends
   `{"type": "hello", "token": "<session token>", "lastSeq": <number | null>, "protocolVersion": <n>}`.
2. The server answers `ready` with a snapshot of what the account can see and
   the current event sequence number.
3. If `lastSeq` was given, the events since then that the account may see follow
   as `event` frames — with gaps, since events it may not see are skipped — and
   then `synced`. If the log no longer reaches back that far, `resync` tells the
   client to discard what it has and reconnect with `lastSeq: null`.
4. From then on: `event` for durable changes, `ephemeral` for typing, presence
   and similar, and `pong` for the client's `ping`.

The server closes the socket with **4000** for a malformed frame, **4002** for a
protocol version it does not speak, **4003** for a session that is unknown,
expired, signed out or revoked, and **4004** for an account that must choose a
new password before it can continue.
