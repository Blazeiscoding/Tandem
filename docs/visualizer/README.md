# Tandem project atlas

Open [PROJECT-VISUALIZER.html](../PROJECT-VISUALIZER.html) in a browser. It is one
offline HTML file containing the inventory, reviewed runtime explanations,
complete text source, declaration/import indexes, guided flows and improvement
evidence. No server, CDN, login or application data is needed.

For a browser preview through a local server:

```sh
pnpm visualizer:build
pnpm visualizer:serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4178`. `VISUALIZER_PORT` changes the loopback port. The server
serves only the generated page and does not expose arbitrary repository files.

Press `/` or `Ctrl K` anywhere to search file names, declarations, journeys and
changes together.

- **Overview** maps how the browser, desktop app, shared interface, client
  replica, protocol and server connect, charts how much code each layer holds and
  names the areas inside each layer.
- **Files** is a folder tree beside a reader. Filter the tree by name, kind or
  layer, or tick **Search inside files too** to match source text. A file opens on
  its explanation; **Source** shows the whole file with find, go to line, line
  wrapping and an outline, **Declarations** lists what it defines and its named
  tests, and **Connections** draws what it imports and what imports it. Click a
  line number to copy a link to that line. Arrow keys move through the tree.
- **How it works** follows one action through the code, step by step. Its
  handoff map shows which layer each step works in.
- **Improvements** groups open, measured and implemented changes, each with its
  before and after, mechanism, measurements, files and limits.
- **Scope & limits** says what the atlas can and cannot show.

Every view, file, tab and line has its own address, so Back, Forward and copied
links work. The page follows the device's light or dark setting; the button in
the top bar picks Onyx, White or the device setting and remembers the choice.
Beside the file tree and the journey list the navigation folds to icons. On a
phone it moves into a menu and the file tree and reader take turns.

## Maintaining the atlas

The generator reads `git ls-files` plus its explicitly owned atlas inputs. It
never scans ignored builds, dependencies, user data or unrelated untracked
directories. The generated output excludes itself to avoid recursive embedding.
Binary files retain size/hash metadata; text files are embedded in full.

The reviewed runtime narratives live in `content/client.json`, `server.json` and
`desktop.json`. `content/optimizations.json` records before/after behavior,
mechanisms, evidence and limits. `content/guide.json` provides the architecture,
reading guide and scope. Update these alongside a changed runtime file. Keep
unimplemented findings marked `follow-up`; do not turn a plan or diagnostic into
a completed optimization.

```sh
pnpm exec prettier --write scripts/generate-project-visualizer.mjs scripts/serve-project-visualizer.mjs docs/visualizer
pnpm visualizer:build
pnpm visualizer:check
pnpm visualizer:test
```

The generator requires a reviewed entry for every `apps/*/src` and
`packages/*/src` runtime file, validates referenced paths and unique guide IDs,
and uses TypeScript's parser to extract declarations and literal imports.
Remaining file descriptions use structural metadata. Imports are a source
dependency map, not a dynamic call graph or proof of test execution.

`--check` compares the deterministic output to current inputs while preserving
the capture's base revision, date and tracked count, so committing the generated
file does not make identical inputs stale. The page shows the
checkout's base commit and an aggregate input SHA-256. It does not claim that
local modifications belong to the base commit. Runtime inputs are always the
actual current files, not an older commit's source. The page embeds source as
escaped JSON and renders text safely; it never executes embedded application
code. The generated HTML is intentionally excluded from Prettier because its
embedded source and data are deterministic generator output.

The page embeds the Latin subsets of Onest and Geist Mono from the web app's
installed `@fontsource-variable` packages, so it matches Tandem offline.
Run `pnpm install` first; the generator stops if they are missing. Layer colours
group the eleven areas into six layers so a colour can name one: the five hues
and the neutral were checked for colour-vision separation on both themes, and
every chart also labels its values.

The [atlas validation record](VALIDATION.md) covers its generator and browser
interactions.
